# DecisionTree and adaboost fro Scratch Machine learning

This Mini-project contains the implementation of a Decision Tree algorithm for both classification and regression tasks, as well as an AdaBoost classifier algorithm in Python. The aim of this project is to understand the core concepts behind these machine learning algorithms and to practice their implementation from scratch.
